# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      The design is a simple counter, utilizing 4 D Flip Flops. The counter is incremented by a CLK signal or a push button.
      The #1 switch is an enable, either allowing the count to increment or stay at current value.
      4 bit output indicates count.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Design should be tested with push button on CLK input, SW1, and 4 LEDs on outputs 0-3. 
      SW1 will enable counter. Push button increments. LED output will indicate 4 bit binary count.
